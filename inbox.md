# Team topology pure model extraction

⟦AI:FKST⟧

## Control Runbook

Before executing, read and obey:

- `/Users/pottersun/Desktop/sbt_projects/aevatar-frontend-loop/visible-codex-refactor-loop-operating-plan.md`
- `/Users/pottersun/Desktop/sbt_projects/aevatar/AGENTS.md`

The control runbook is the visible supervisor policy for this Aevatar FKST task. If it conflicts with package defaults, fail closed and record the conflict rather than expanding scope silently.

## Host Configuration

- Host repo: `/Users/pottersun/Desktop/sbt_projects/aevatar`
- Integration branch: `auto-frontend-dev`
- Current control repo: `/Users/pottersun/Desktop/sbt_projects/aevatar-frontend-loop`
- FKST wrapper: `/Users/pottersun/Desktop/sbt_projects/aevatar-frontend-loop/scripts/fkst-aevatar`
- Integration sync script: `/Users/pottersun/Desktop/sbt_projects/aevatar-frontend-loop/scripts/sync-aevatar-integration`

## Required Pre-task Sync

Before implementation work starts, synchronize remote `origin/dev` into `auto-frontend-dev` by running this from the control repo:

```bash
/Users/pottersun/Desktop/sbt_projects/aevatar-frontend-loop/scripts/sync-aevatar-integration
```

This sync is the only allowed direct push to the integration branch. If the sync has conflicts, requires destructive git operations, or cannot push cleanly, stop and report the blocker instead of continuing the task.

## Host Protected Path Policy

Do not modify backend, proto, API, actor, projection, workflow engine/backend paths, backend/runtime infrastructure, database, backend tests, backend config, or architecture docs. Frontend page runtime helpers under `apps/aevatar-console-web/src/pages/**/runtime/**` are allowed for frontend/product tasks. If a backend error appears, only locate, reproduce, record, attribute, and risk-label it, then write exactly:

`后端错误已记录，按用户要求未修改`

## Trigger Source

User-created FKST inbox task from the Aevatar control repo.

## Root Cause

Use real product/UI investigation from the Aevatar host repo and the runbook. Do not infer from memory.

## Fix Path

Implement the narrowest frontend/product slice that satisfies the task details below, using isolated FKST worktrees and the configured integration branch. Do not create PRs below the runbook threshold unless the user explicitly authorized that exception.

## Task Details

Rationalized source requirements covered: original item 3 and the topology part of item 2.

Current repo facts:
- Team topology derivation is currently embedded in `apps/aevatar-console-web/src/pages/teams/detail.tsx`.
- Prior review reported React element creation inside topology/view-model derivation; verify against current code before changing.

Goal:
Separate topology graph data derivation from React rendering so topology logic is pure, testable, and reusable.

Expected implementation:
- Add `deriveTeamTopologyViewModel(...)` or similar pure function.
- Produce plain DTOs such as `TopologyNodeViewModel`, `TopologyEdgeViewModel`, and `TopologyEntityMap` with serializable fields needed by the renderer.
- Move any `React.createElement` or JSX label creation out of model derivation and into the topology tab/rendering component.
- Keep graph visual behavior equivalent; only change the data/render boundary.

Acceptance criteria:
- Topology derivation can be unit tested without rendering React.
- Tests cover nodes, edges, entity lookup/detail rows, and at least one missing/partial data case.
- Existing topology/detail UI remains visually and behaviorally equivalent in focused verification.

Explicit exclusions:
- Do not implement original item 7 style tokenization.
- Do not modify backend, API, workflow engine, actor, projection, database, backend config, or architecture docs.

## Files allowlist

- `src/**`
- `apps/**`
- `packages/**`
- `components/**`
- `pages/**`
- `public/**`
- `styles/**`
- `tests/**`

## Verification

- Run focused frontend checks appropriate to touched files.
- Run `git diff --check`.
- Use visible browser verification when a local frontend page is available.
- If tests are modified, run `bash tools/ci/test_stability_guards.sh`.
