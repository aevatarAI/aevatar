# Codex Refactor Loop — Unattended Three-Phase Mode

You are the **Controller**. You never edit production code yourself. You orchestrate `codex exec` subprocesses that do all analysis, implementation, and verification work in isolated git worktrees.

Each `/loop` wakeup runs **one iteration tick**: inspect `.refactor-loop/state.json`, advance whichever phase is ready, schedule the next wakeup. Stop when `clusters_planned == clusters_done`.

This skill complements `refactor-team` (Agent-subagent based). Use this skill when the user wants:
- True OS-level parallelism via worktrees
- Each phase as an independent `codex exec` process (not a Claude subagent)
- Dynamic `/loop` self-pacing rather than fixed cron

---

## Quick start

```bash
# user types:
/loop <task description... 完全无人值守模式>
```

First wakeup → bootstrap state, dispatch audit codex, schedule fallback wakeup, end turn.

Subsequent wakeups → read state, advance any cluster that's ready, schedule next wakeup.

---

## Phase 0 — Bootstrap (first wakeup only)

If `.refactor-loop/state.json` does not exist:

```bash
mkdir -p .refactor-loop/{logs,runs,clusters,prompts,worktrees,state}
```

Write initial `state.json`:

```json
{
  "schema_version": 1,
  "trunk_branch": "<current branch>",
  "max_parallel_clusters": 3,
  "iteration": 1,
  "phase": "audit",
  "clusters_planned": [],
  "clusters_active": [],
  "clusters_done": [],
  "clusters_failed": []
}
```

Create top-level TaskCreate items: audit / dispatch / merge.

---

## Phase 1 — Audit (one codex)

1. Copy `prompts/audit.md` (this skill's template) to `.refactor-loop/prompts/audit-iter-N.md`.
2. Replace `{{iteration}}` placeholder.
3. Dispatch:

   ```bash
   .claude/skills/codex-refactor-loop/scripts/spawn-codex.sh \
     --cd "$REPO_ROOT" \
     --prompt .refactor-loop/prompts/audit-iter-N.md \
     --log .refactor-loop/logs/audit-iter-N.log \
     --timeout 1800
   ```

   Use Bash with `run_in_background: true`.

4. Schedule wakeup 1200–1800s as safety net (task notification is primary wake).
5. **End turn.**

When task notification fires → read `audit-iter-N.md` output, populate `clusters_planned`, split into batches (max `max_parallel_clusters` per batch) by **file/project disjointness**:

- Two clusters that touch the same `.csproj` or share a file path go in different batches.
- Two clusters that touch the same proto file → different batches.

Update state, advance to Phase 2.

---

## Phase 2 — Implement (parallel codexes, one per cluster in current batch)

For each cluster in the current batch:

1. Create worktree:

   ```bash
   git worktree add -b refactor/iterN-<cluster-id> \
     .refactor-loop/worktrees/<cluster-id> HEAD
   ```

2. Materialize prompt: copy `prompts/implement.md`, replace placeholders (`{{cluster_id}}`, `{{worktree_path}}`, `{{branch}}`, `{{old_pattern}}`, `{{new_principle}}`, `{{scope_paths}}`, `{{verification_hints}}`). Save to `.refactor-loop/prompts/implement-<cluster-id>.md`.

3. Dispatch via `spawn-codex.sh --cd <worktree>` with `--timeout 5400` (90 min).

4. Update `clusters_active` with `bg_task` id.

After all parallel dispatches, schedule wakeup 1800s safety net. **End turn.**

When each task notification fires → check log tail for `IMPLEMENT_DONE:<cluster-id>:<status>`:
- `ok` → advance that cluster to Phase 3 (verify).
- `partial` / `blocked` → move to `clusters_failed`, log reason, optionally re-dispatch with corrected prompt.

Do **not** advance the whole batch in lockstep; verify each cluster independently as soon as its implement finishes.

---

## Phase 3 — Verify (one codex per cluster, independent of implement codex)

For each cluster whose implement finished `ok`:

1. Materialize `prompts/verify.md` → `.refactor-loop/prompts/verify-<cluster-id>.md`.
2. Dispatch in the same worktree (verify reads `git diff HEAD`, runs full test/guard suite, gates merge):

   ```bash
   .claude/skills/codex-refactor-loop/scripts/spawn-codex.sh \
     --cd <worktree> \
     --prompt .refactor-loop/prompts/verify-<cluster-id>.md \
     --log .refactor-loop/logs/verify-<cluster-id>.log \
     --timeout 3600
   ```

3. End turn after dispatching all ready verifies. Wait for task notifications.

Verify output marker: `VERIFY_DONE:<cluster-id>:<verdict>` where verdict ∈ `{pass, rework, abort}`.

- `pass` → advance to Phase 4 (merge).
- `rework` → re-dispatch implement codex with verifier's findings appended.
- `abort` → move to `clusters_failed`, surface in PushNotification.

---

## Phase 4 — Merge & Push (controller, not codex)

For each `pass` cluster, serially:

1. In trunk worktree (`$REPO_ROOT`):
   ```bash
   git merge --no-ff refactor/iterN-<cluster-id> -m "Merge cluster-<id>: <short title>"
   ```
2. Run local CI gates (the ones listed in CLAUDE.md "CI 门禁"):
   ```bash
   bash tools/ci/architecture_guards.sh
   bash tools/ci/solution_split_guards.sh
   bash tools/ci/solution_split_test_guards.sh
   bash tools/ci/test_stability_guards.sh
   # plus any cluster-specific guards from audit.verification_hints
   ```
3. On pass → `git push origin <trunk_branch>`.
4. On conflict or CI fail → `git merge --abort`, mark cluster `rework`, re-dispatch implement codex with conflict details.

After merge → `git worktree remove .refactor-loop/worktrees/<cluster-id>`, `git branch -d refactor/iterN-<cluster-id>` (only if pushed).

If no clusters left in current batch → start next batch (Phase 2 again). If no batches left → start next iteration (Phase 1 again) or stop.

---

## Loop control

- **Stop conditions**: all planned clusters done OR every remaining cluster failed twice.
- **Stop action**: omit ScheduleWakeup, TaskStop any monitor, send one-line PushNotification with summary.
- **Wakeup cadence**:
  - Primary: harness task notifications (auto on codex exit).
  - Fallback: 1200–1800s ScheduleWakeup (matches /loop dynamic mode guidance).

---

## Hard rules (controller-level, propagated into every codex prompt)

1. **No new features** — only clean violations of CLAUDE.md philosophy.
2. **No external repo changes** — NyxID / chrono-* are out of scope.
3. **Code self-documents the refactor** — every refactored type/method gets a 3-5 line comment of the form `// Refactor (iterN/cluster-XXX): Old pattern: …  New principle: …`.
4. **No `commit`/`push`/`checkout` inside codex prompts** — the controller owns git topology.
5. **No `Task.Delay`-based test pacing** — tests must use deterministic awaiters.
6. **No `[Skip]` / disabled tests** as a way to make CI green.
7. **No scope creep** — codex must print `SCOPE_EXTEND: <file> <reason>` before touching anything outside `scope_paths`.
